    excerpt: "Discover the most effective exercise techniques to maximize fat burning and accelerate your weight loss journey.",
    content: `
      <div class="article-content">
        <h2>Understanding Fat Burning</h2>
        <p>To maximize fat burning, it's important to understand how your body uses different energy systems during exercise.</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
          <h3>Energy Systems</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Phosphagen System:</strong> Short bursts of high-intensity activity</li>
            <li><strong>Glycolytic System:</strong> Medium-duration, moderate to high intensity</li>
            <li><strong>Oxidative System:</strong> Long-duration, low to moderate intensity</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</h2>
        <p>HIIT is one of the most effective methods for burning fat and improving cardiovascular fitness.</p>
        
        <div class="exercise-detail">
          <h3>HIIT Benefits</h3>
          <p>HIIT workouts typically last 20-30 minutes and can burn more calories than longer steady-state cardio sessions. The high-intensity intervals create an "afterburn effect" that continues to burn calories for hours after your workout.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Strength Training for Fat Loss</h2>
        <p>Building muscle through strength training is crucial for long-term fat loss and metabolic health.</p>
        
        <div class="exercise-detail">
          <h3>Strength Training Benefits</h3>
          <p>Muscle tissue is metabolically active, meaning it burns calories even at rest. Regular strength training increases your basal metabolic rate and helps maintain muscle mass during weight loss.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Steady-State Cardio</h2>
        <p>While HIIT is excellent for fat burning, steady-state cardio also plays an important role in your fitness routine.</p>
        
        <div class="exercise-detail">
          <h3>Steady-State Benefits</h3>
          <p>Longer, moderate-intensity sessions are excellent for building endurance and burning fat during the workout. They're also easier to maintain for longer periods, making them ideal for beginners.</p>
